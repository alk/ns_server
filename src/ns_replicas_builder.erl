%% @doc this implements creating replication stream for particular
%% vbucket from some node to bunch of other nodes and waiting until
%% all backfills are done. It is also possible to shutdown some
%% replications earlier then others.
%%
%% NOTE: this code can be structured as gen_server, but I decided
%% against that. Reason is that I'd like to keep logic straight and
%% fsm-less, but if you, my dear reader, is planning any extra
%% features here, please, consider refactoring it into gen_server.

%% @doc spawns replicas builder for given bucket, vbucket, source and
%% destination node(s). AfterDone will be called after all backfills
%% are done, so it can notify whoever is interested in this event. For
%% JustBackfillNodes it'll backfill replicas just as for any other
%% destination node, but it'll stop replication when backfill is done
%% (and before AfterDone is called). Replicas on ReplicateIntoNodes
%% will be built and replication will continue maintaining them even
%% when AfterDone is called and after it returns.
%%
%% When replicas are built and AfterDone is called this process will
%% wait EXIT signal from parent, on which it'll reliably terminate
%% child replicator and exit.
